# Lifestyles-KB a fuzzy ontology for lifestyle profiling

Lifestyles-KB.fdl  is the fuzzy DL ontology

Lifestyles-KB.owl is an equivalent crisp  sub-version of the fuzzy one

The ontology is described in:

[1] Couch potato or gym addict? Semantic lifestyle profiling with wearables and knowledge graphs. Natalia ~DÃ­az-RodrÃ­guez, Aki HÃ¤rmÃ¤, Ignacio Huitzil, Rim Helaoui, Fernando Bobillo and Umberto Straccia. Submitted to NIPS workshop on Automatic Knowledge Base Construction, 2017, Long Beach, CA.

## Running the clustering algorithms for fuzzy datatype learning:

The clustering application is done in Java, and a .jar executable allows to select the csv files to apply clustering on. All data records .csv must be contained in a data/folder and there must be only .csv files in that folder.
It requires a config.txt file that contains pairs of integers separated by comma where each integer is the index of the column (starting by 0) followed by the number of clusters to extract for that column (in clustering types 1 and 2).
E.g.to apply clustering on columns 2,3, and 4 with 5 clusters each, the following config file would be provided:

```
1,5,2,5,3,5
```
If some of the columns is NOT numerical, please remove it from the config file (e.g., First column is not used in our example because it indicates the day segment type).


To run the 3 clustering algorithms:

```
>java -jar FuzzyDatatypeLearner.jar 1     # option 1: fuzzy-k means clustering
>java -jar FuzzyDatatypeLearner.jar 2     #option 2: k means clustering
>java -jar FuzzyDatatypeLearner.jar 3     #option 3: Mean-shift clustering
```

To save the datatypes into a fuzzyDL ontology file .fdl, we can run

```
java -jar FuzzyDatatypeLearner.jar 1  >>  fuzzOnt.fdl
```

Example of output for two columns for day segment (commute) "ToWork":
```

## Some notes about Day Segments and other datatypes:  

The basic unit in which a day footprint is divided into is a day segment. Fixed day segments by clock
0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24h exists, although regular ones such as morning (the time between waking up
and going to work) are based on behaviour sensing. They are provided with start and end time -in
minutes-, each of them divided into:

* Home, H â€“ All places user calls â€˜Homeâ€™ or where the user is last thing in the evening and
first thing in the morning.
* Work, W â€“ All places the user calls â€˜Workâ€™, â€˜Philipsâ€™, â€˜HTCâ€™ or where the user regularly
commutes to and from or is in the middle of a weekday.
* Key points, K â€“ Frequented places in W <â€“> H transfers where the user regularly stops at
(kindergarten, supermarket, fitness centre). K has no loops.
* Other places, O - All other places that users visit either from H or W. These will often be
more sporadically visited places, such as restaurants, theaters, museums or other cities.

* Examples of segmentType:
```

```

## Data used for learning the fuzzy datatypes:

 Each file contains a stack of days from one individual used and each day consists of a fixed set of segments. Each file contains the same segments but there may be a different number of days, and therefore the number of segments too.


## Using the Lifestyles-KB ontology:

For seeing examples of queries on fuzzyDL reasoner, we refer the reader to the examples section in the fuzzyDL website.

## TO-DOs:

* An updated jar file will be made public soon. Due to privacy, the data cannot be shared at the moment.
* Comment normalization accross versions of fuzzyDL
* Label homogeneization for means-shift clustering (Algorithm option 3)
